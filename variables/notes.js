/* Variables 

-- Use const wherever possible for variables that won't be reassigned.

-- use let for variables that will be reassigned.

-- Avoid using var to protect scope related issues.

-- var is Function scope
-- let, const are block scope (Scope remains in curly braces only) 
    i.e we can use parent variables oin child braces but can not use child variables in parent braces.
