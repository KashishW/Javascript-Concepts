/* Array Methods 

Array methods in JavaScript are built-in functions that allow you to perform various operations on arrays.

Commonly used array methods are:

1. push: Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns new length of array.
2. pop: Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
3. shift: Removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
4. unshift: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns new length of array.
5. concat: Combines two or more arrays into a new array.
6. slice: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array without modifying the original.
7. splice: Adds or removes elements from an array, modifying the original array.
8. forEach: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
9. map: Creates a new array with results of calling a function on every element.
10. filter: Creates a new array with elements that pass a specified test.
11. reduce: Reduces the array to a single value using a reducer function.
12. find: Returns the first element that satisfies the provided testing function.
13. findIndex: Returns the index of the first element that satisfies a testing function.
14. some: Checks if at least one array element passes a specified test.
15. every: Checks if all elements in the array pass a specified test.
16. includes: Checks if an array contains a specified element.
17. sort: Sorts the elements of an array in place.
18. reverse: Reverses the order of elements in an array in place.
19. flat: Flattens nested arrays to a specified depth level.
