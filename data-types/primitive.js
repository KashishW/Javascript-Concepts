/* Data Types :-

- Primitive Data Types
- Object Data Types

-- Primitive Data Types:
    - are immutable (can not be changed after it is created) and are directly assigned by value
    - can hold single simple value

    - Types of Primitive Data Types:
        - Number        (Represents integers and floating-point numbers.)
        - String        (Represents text enclosed in quotes.)
        - Boolean       (Represents true or false.)
        - Null          (Represents an intentionally empty or non-existent value.)
        - Undefined     (Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned.)
        - Symbol        (Used to create unique identifiers.)
        - BigInt        (For handling large integers beyond the Number range.)
